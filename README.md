## Configuration
Default config file stored in directory `$HOME/.gosuv/`

- file `programs.yml` contains all program settings.
- file `config.yml` contains server config

File `config.yml` can be generated by `gosuv conftest`

Example config.yaml

```
server:
  httpauth:
    enabled: false
    username: uu
    password: pp
  addr: :11313
client:
  server_url: http://localhost:11313
```

Logs can be found in `$HOME/.gosuv/log/`

## Design
HTTP is follow the RESTFul guide.

Get or Update program

`<GET|PUT> /api/programs/:name`

Add new program

`POST /api/programs`

Del program

`DELETE /api/programs/:name`

## State
Only 4 states. [ref](http://supervisord.org/subprocess.html#process-states)

![states](docs/states.png)

# Plugin Design (todo)
Current plugins:

- [tailf](https://github.com/codeskyblue/gosuv-tailf)

All command plugin will store in `$HOME/.gosuv/cmdplugin`, gosuv will treat this plugin as a subcommand.

for example:

	$HOME/.gosuv/cmdplugin/ --.
		|- showpid/
			|- run

There is a directory `showpid`

When run `gosuv showpid`, file `run` will be called.
